Hi, everyone.

This is my video submission for real-time animation assignment 2.

and this task was to implement a program that demonstrates Hierarchical Creatures.

This video has two main parts, simple model and complex model.

First u can see that, this is simple model with 2 joints. and this is the FK display mode, which means that u need to change the angle of each joint to reach the target. just like this. if u can reach the target, it will show text "reached".

for IK part, i used the analytical solution to solve this problem. it is very easy to use some cosine law formula to calculate the angle of joint.

the second part is complex model. as u can see, it has two different joint branchs. and each of them has 3 joints.it is more complex than the simple one. And for the FK part, it is the same way to change the angle with the simple model. just like this. 

But for the IK mode, I used the CCD to solve it. and I also add a spline to show the animation of joint's movement. just like this. at the same time, if the target is so far from the joint. it will display text.

Yeah that's all my submission, thank you for watching.
